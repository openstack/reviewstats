Project definitions
-------------------

Each project has a JSON file describing what reviews, bugs and so on will count
towards that projects statistics. The JSON file should have a single top level
object containing the following keys:

* name: The project name.
* subprojects: A list of Gerrit projects to include.
* core-team: A list of Gerrit usernames to consider as core reviewers across
  subprojects.
* lp_projects: A list of Launchpad project ids to include.

Examples
--------

#. Get reviewer stats for the last 14 days (default) in the stable/pike branch:

    ``$ reviewers --stable pike --output ~/reviewers-stable-pike-14``

#. Get reviewer stats for the last 90 days across all stable branches:

    ``$ reviewers --stable all --days 90 --output ~/reviewers-stable-all-90``
